          <b>Part 4 - Your profile</b> 

          <br>
          <br>

          A completed Yammer profile lets your colleagues know who you are. As you are logging on using a generic email address your profile will be set up for your store rather than you as individual. Therefore whilst you can’t use your personal details you can make
          sure the Store Profile contains some key information on the store in general that will help
          others to understand the context of your comments. For example the type of Store you are,
          GM: Food ratio, customer profile and the region you sit within. Let people know the people
          that are accessing the account, for example Commercial Managers or Section Managers.
